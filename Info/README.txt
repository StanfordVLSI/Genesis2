Q. What does the "Change" number mean (in Genesis2.info)?

A. IIRC Genesis2 was originally developed using Perforce as its
version control system. I think the change number was simply the
sequential number of the latest merge i.e. "Change 11905" would mean
the 11905th time something got merged into the official code base.

Now, we are using git for version control, so this doesn't have the
same meaning. What I am doing (for now) is manually incrementing the
change number every time a major change gets merged to master.

Yes this is terrible. But for now, maybe it keeps things moving forward.
