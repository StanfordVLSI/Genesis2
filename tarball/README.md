Notes, Feb 2017:

r11879-bsd.tar.bz2 is the tarball we've been sending out over the last
couple of years as the official release, except recently changed to
include a BSD freeware license in place of the old copyright.

The "boilerplate" files are the standard verbage we send out with the tarball.

NOTE the source files in the tarball do not currently match very well
with the sources in the github repository...te github sources are
newer, I think, by a couple of perforce revisions...fixing this will
require a special project...
