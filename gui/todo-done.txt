OLD/DONE: see todo-done.txt


New regime crashes on FloatingPointGen??

1. Security holes (mounting /cad on vlsiweb)

SUBPARMS = &SPECIAL_DATA_MEM_OPS.0=%.deleteme&SPECIAL_DATA_MEM_OPS.30=%.deleteme

querystring = "newdesign=cmpdemo
&curdesign=..%2Fdesigns%2Ftgt0%2Fcmpdemo-111008-074714.js
&modpath=top.DUT.p0
&DBG=1
&TIE_OPCODE_WIDTH=6

&USE_SHIM=off
&DATA_BUS_WIDTH=32
&USE_XT=SIM4Xtensa
&SPECIAL_DATA_MEM_OPS.0=%.deleteme
&SPECIAL_DATA_MEM_OPS.30=%.deleteme"


This one seems to have gone away...(10/17/2011)...?
Floatingpointgen
=> inside testbench=>any transaction (e.g. TransGenA)
=> change blank parm "NamedTransCtrl" to "A" and Submit
=> "A" disappears

I think this one is not presently in my court: see ~/gui-megan-bug-notes.txt

htpasswd removal (DONE): see ~/gui-security-notes.txt

is there a good way to make updatedesigndirs work with symbolic links instead of copying...?
problem is 1) need to overwrite file occasionally (BAD REASON) and 
2) need to touch the xml file for makefile to work correctly (another bad reason)

add/subtract array items:
  - see e.g. megan_tile:top.DUT.PC2XBAR_REQ_SIGNALS
  - add minus and plus circles to left of each array item
    - minus deletes the item; plus clones it

misc
  - figure out how to publish
  - DONE? find and remove thing that creates "tmpdbg"
  - DONE? scrub and checkin changes
  - DONE? reconstruct tgt0-baseline.xml, see if parm order improves
  - add DBG option to choosedesign, opendesign settable from index.htm
  - add snazzy logo to splash page / find a tree logo for index_stanford (DONE 10/2011)

SECURITY!
- Create a tab-separated list "designs/design_list.txt" of design directories.
- On startup, make a dir "designs/design_name" for each directory in list.
  You know where.
- Make sure each has a SysCfgs subdirectory?
- designs/updatedesign.csh consults with "design_list.txt"
  to see where to find each new design.

misc
  - look at making "cancel" and "submit" buttons look like buttons
  - preserve parm order after submit!??

===================================================================================================
1/9/2012 I'm calling this FIXED until I hear otherwise...?

Notes from sometime around 12/2011:

1. configs_stanford is wrong.
2. editdesigns nonetheless uses genesis/configs/something_else??

In vlsiweb:/var/www/homepage/genesis/, 
CONFIG.TXT points to 

In /var/www/homepage/genesis/configs/CONFIG_stanford.txt,
DESIGN_LIST points to
   /home/steveri/gui/configs/design_list_stanford.txt (WRONG)

updatedesigndirs appears to be using design list in genesis/configs (why??)

editdesigns appear to be using design list in steveri/configs

steveri/configs: FPdemo is commented out
genesis/configs: FPdemo NOT commented out

genesis splash page (updatedesigndirs) shows FPdemo, must be using steveri/configs (check)
genesis editdesigns.pl shows NO FPdemo, must be using genesis/configs (why?)

[os 5/3] Two small issues I ran into:

DONE 5/2012 * I tried to remove some old designs from the design list and add a
DONE 5/2012   new one instead. One got removed. one got added. one can not be

DONE 5/2012 * When choosing an empty xml, it used to detect that and do an initial

[os 5/4] Some issues I found:

DONE 5/2012 * When I have a compound structure (list of hash) and I try to change
DONE 5/2012   a leaf element value in the hash, I cannot click submit. The button
DONE 5/2012   does not do anything.

This should work:

==============================================================================
New procedure will look like this:

% $CHIPGEN/gui/bin/stewie clone $CHIPGEN/gui /tmp/mystewie
% cd /tmp/mystewie/configs; ln -s setup_stanford.cshrc setup.csrhc
% cp $CHIPGEN/gui/configs/design_list_stanford.txt /tmp/mystewie/configs
% stewie start /tmp/mystewie

Try this:
  ssh neva
  unset path
  $CHIPGEN/gui/bin/stewie 

WHEN WE COME BACK
  - stewie.pl should call "./$exe" and not "$exe"
  - megan's stewie didn't make a scratch directory!?
  - megan's stewie had no setup.cshrc file
  - (megan used the "clone" install I think)
  - something with /tmp/stewie_msgs or something.
  - design-list issues (see below)
  - horrible bug in editdesigns.pl:make_backup_file(): hardwired /var/www...
  - others (see mail)

==============================================================================
(The fix will be in gui/bin/stewie.pl:  Instead of

         if ($path =~ /\/?cgi\/(.*)/) { # E.g. "cgi/opendesign.pl"
             my $exe = $1;
             print "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n";
             print `cd cgi; $exe`;  # Execute the perl file

the last line will say:

             print `cd cgi; ./$exe`;  # Execute the perl file

Hi Steve,

I'm installing Luie...

1. The issue with copy design list to backup or die almost killed me
again, but I knew about it so I commented it out. It is the almost
last line of editdesigns.pl.

2. I noticed that when I add a new design to the webform, and click an
extra submit, it also copies the new design to the delete list.

3. It would be nice if Luie, when looking for a design in the design
list but not finding it, will give some friendly message. It is not
its fault that some drive was not mounted on the VM but it would have
saved debug time.

(4. we ned to replace the tgt0_example with one that does not require
SMASH or any stanford related setup)

Other than that, I am just a few permission and definition issues from
crowning Luie the third (1:Stanford, 2:CMU, 3:Google??)

Long live the king!
Ofer.

Hi Steve

I was able to get it to partially run but not completely.

1. It must have /. as part of the path before the gui is launched. It
is not enough to add it to the config/setup.cshrc

2. In cgi/editdesigns.pl there are two small bugs:

"File cannot be copied. at ./editdesigns.pl line 389." -- It tries to
backup old files, but since one does not exists it dies. Once
commented things work better.

"Can't return outside a subroutine at ./editdesigns.pl line 34." --
you have a random "return;" statement there. I think it should be
commented out.

3. All stewies are writing the same msg file:

"sh: /tmp/stewie_msgs.txt: Permission denied" -- Maybe it is better if
they write to a file where the gui was started from? or with the port#
as part of the file name?

4. Once 1 and 2 or bypassed, the gui comes up. I can choose a design
and brows it, but unfortunately when I make a change and click submit
it breaks. I have not figured out why. It seems to know how to
generate a design since when I start with empty.xml it generates
everything and I can see the hierarchy. But if I then change a param
and submit, I get a page that does not show any design.

5. Is it possible that Stewie is the memory leak? we had no problem
with neva-2 until we started playing with it. and no problem with neva
until we started puting stewie to work on it. Circumstantial deviance
only...

Ofer.

Hi Steve,

I decided to do a model of installing stewie. I tried it on neva at /tmp/stewie/ and things worked nicely initially, but I can't get it to fully work. It's on neva:8080 but once I click on choose your own design, things break. Here is what I did and what I see in the shell when I try to connect using either firefox on neva, neva-2 or chrome on my machine.

neva:/tmp/stewie/gui>./bin/stewie start
WARNING: Deleting existing index.htm
WARNING: Deleting existing CONFIG.TXT

Will attempt to bind to port 8080
To stop server:
  kill 25544

I will attempt to launch firefox for you because you're so lazy.
If there are problems, look for errors in "/tmp/stewie-ff.25543.log"
