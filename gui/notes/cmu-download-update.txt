Jolin: I'm sending you three files
  gui/0-template.php (to replace existing 0-template.php)
  gui/Misc.js (to add as a new file in the gui directory)
  gui/cgi/buildtarball.pl (to add as a new file in the cgi directory)

You should diff the old and new 0-template.php files to see what's
changed, and then add in the new changes to your copy of 0-template.php.

Misc.js and buildtarball.pl have some system-dependent information at
the top of each file that you may have to edit.  In particular,
Misc.js has

  var CGI_URL = "/cgi-bin/ig/"; // Where to find cgi programs for gui.

...which you will probably change to read

  var CGI_URL = "/cgi-bin/genesis/"; // Where to find cgi programs for gui.




...and in "buildtarball.pl" you will need to change

  my $GUI_HOME_DIR = "~steveri/smart_memories/Smart_design/ChipGen/bin/Genesis2Tools/gui";
  my $GUI_HOME_URL = "/ig";                         # URL path used to access the gui.
  my $BUILDTARBALL = "/cgi-bin/ig/buildtarball.pl"; # URL path used to
  access this script.

to:

  my $GUI_HOME_DIR = [your directory name here]
  my $GUI_HOME_URL = "/gui";                             # URL path used to access the gui.
  my $BUILDTARBALL = "/cgi-bin/genesis/buildtarball.pl"; # URL path used to access this script.





Note: I decided not to use the Makefile at all for the download, so
there's no need for the Makefile changes that I talked about in
previous e-mail...

Let me know when you run into trouble!
Steve
