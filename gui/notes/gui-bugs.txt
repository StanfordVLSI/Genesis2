1. ("undefined" vs. "no comment"): Easy to fix.  I'll probably use ""
   (null) when there's no comment, unless you have a strong preference
   for something else.  (PS The "no comment" phrase is actually from
   the XML, e.g. it has "<comment>no comment</comment>")

2. (Comments disappear on change): Oops, this one might take awhile to
   fix.

3. (Parameter box aligned to right): Don't know the problem yet, but
   I'm guessing it's easy to fix.

4. (Unnecessary "immutable parameters" headline): should be an easy
   fix.

Also, I noticed that:

1. immutable parameters have a default explanation of "undefined"
   whereas regular parameters has "no comment". I think "no comment"
   or "parameter not yet documented" or something to that effect are
   better than "undefined".

2. When I regenerate the deom, the comments disappear. I'm guessing
   that's because you planted the comments in the initial xml and not
   in the actual genesis source code (the .vp file) so the generated
   xmls, other than the first have no comments in them. True?

3. go to "top.DUT.p0.rf" the parameter box is aligned to the right
   side for some reason..

4. minor nit-picky detail: when there are no immutable parameters,
   there is no need to print the "immutable parameters"
   headline. (E.g., the top level of the demo)

Otherwise, it looks great and I plan to show it off to everyone. I
might even try to remember to not take the credit for it ;-))
