It appears to be choking on a comment.  That's a good thing, because
now we can finally start debugging comments.  I haven't looked yet to
see what's in the .vp source, but the xml that's being generated looks
like this (see
/home/wachs/smart_memories/Smart_design/ChipGen/TileTest/TileGenTest/gui/1proc_2dummy_new.xml):


    <ParameterItem>
      <Doc></Doc>
      <Name>Number of Free (deallocate) Ports</Name>
      <Range></Range>
      <Val>1</Val>
    </ParameterItem>

I.e. it appears that somebody thought that "Number of Free..." was the
*name* of the parameter <Name> , rather than a comment field <Comment>...

...which provokes the xml-to-js script to try and build this:

cgtop.SubInstances.DUT
     .SubInstances.drh0
     .SubInstances.rh2pc_state.Comments.Number of Free (deallocate)
     .Parameters.Number of Free (deallocate) Ports = "1";

This appears to be a bug with either the source code using the wrong
syntax, or Genesis2 interpreting the syntax incorrectly...I'll let you
and Ofer fight it out to decide which is the case...
