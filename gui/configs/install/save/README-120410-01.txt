=== 0. Where to install ===

Installation should take place on the same machine that is running
your web server.  It might work better if you have root access and/or
at least be running as the same user and group as the web server.
Example:

  % ssh webserver -l root

OR

  % ssh webserver -l apache

If you don't have access to the webserver account, and/or if it
doesn't even have an account, you can try to do the install as
yourself.  It's still a good idea to be on the webserver machine,
however.  And you'll probably need root access (e.g. <tt>sudo</tt>) to
install the files in the right place and give the correct final
permissions.

=== 1. Save the tarball ===

Someone should have given you a compressed release tarball
<b><tt>gui.tar.bz2.</tt></b> Make a directory and put the tarball in
it.

NOTE: Running from "/tmp" might help avoid permission problems.  This
is what I have to do to install at Stanford.

Example:

  % mkdir /tmp/unpackgui
  % mv gui.tar.bz2 /tmp/unpackgui

=== 2. Unpack ===
Unpack the gui.  Example:

  % cd /tmp/unpackgui
  % tar xvjf gui.tar.bz2

You should see one file (<tt>README.txt</tt>) and one directory (<tt>gui</tt>).

  % ls -1F
  README.txt
  gui/

=== 3. Upgrade existing install OR ===
If you are updating an existing installation, simply copy the new
files in place of the old.  For paranoia's sake, it's probably good
to preserve a copy of the existing installation before overwriting
it with the new update.  For instance, at Stanford we would do:

  % mkdir ~/genesis.save
  % cp -r /var/www/homepage/genesis ~/genesis.save
  % cd /tmp/unpackgui
  % sudo cp -r gui/* /var/www/homepage/genesis

If updating, YOU ARE DONE, DO NOT PROCEED.

Otherwise, if this is a new install, move on to the next step, below.

=== 4. New install ===
For a new install, cd to the install directory
<tt>gui/configs/install</tt>.  Run the install script
<tt>INSTALL.sh</tt> and follow the directions.
Note that you'll probably need to have full root privilege 
(e.g. <tt>sudo</tt>) for everything to work properly.

  % cd /tmp/unpackgui
  % cd gui/configs/install
  % sudo ./INSTALL.sh

of course, if you don't have access to <tt>sudo</tt>, you'll instead be doing something like

  % su root
  # ./INSTALL.sh

INSTALL.sh will want to know and/or will try to guess the following
information (examples are from Stanford's installation at
http://www-vlsi.stanford.edu/genesis - feel free to visit there for
reference purposes):

* what is your web-server URL (e.g. "http://www-vlsi.stanford.edu")
* where do cgi files live on your server (e.g. "<tt>/usr/lib/cgi_bin</tt>")
* what pathname does your server use to access cgi files (e.g. "<tt>/cgi-bin</tt>")
* where do "/" level html files live on your server (e.g. "<tt>/var/www/homepage</tt>")
* what is the username of the web server (e.g. "<tt>www-data</tt>")
* what group name (for <tt>chgrp</tt>) can the web server access(e.g. "<tt>www-data</tt>")



NOTE: By default
the installation will create a website called "genesis," e.g. its
URL will be "http://your-site.com/genesis" and the cgi files will live
in e.g. "http://your-site.com/cgi/genesis".  If for some reason you
cannot use the default install name "genesis", and/or if you want to
make a separate test installation with a different name, you should
use the "-test" option for INSTALL.sh, e.g.

  % cd /tmp/unpackgui
  % cd gui/configs/install
  % sudo ./INSTALL.sh -test genesis_test_install

This (above) would create a web site
    http://your-site.com/genesis_test_install

...instead of the default
    http://your-site.com/genesis

=== 5. Set permissions ===
Note the instructions at the end of the INSTALL script, which will 
tell you how to set correct permissions such that the web server 
can use the new installation.  You'll be doing something like this:

  % chown -R www-data /var/www/homepage/genesis
  % chgrp -R www-data /var/www/homepage/genesis

  % chown -R www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/genesis
  % chgrp -R www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/genesis

=== 6. Optional cleanup ===
Once installation is complete, you no longer need the contents of
the unpacking directory, which can safely be deleted.

  % rm /tmp/unpackgui
