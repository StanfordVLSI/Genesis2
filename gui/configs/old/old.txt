maybe a...perl script thing or...what if they don't have perl
installed where i think...maybe an sh script that says do this:
/usr/bin/perl <filename>

...or maybe that searches for perl and, if it finds it, executes
perl -f install-script.pl and otherwise says "hey where's perl"
something like that

distribution package would look something like...

Installation instructions
1. make a directory and put the tarball in it
Example:
  % mkdir /home/mydir/unpackgui
  % cp chipgengui.tar.gz /home/mydir/gui-unpack

2. Unpack the gui
Example:
  % cd /home/mydir/unpackgui
  % tar xvf chipgengui.tar.gz | gunzip

3. You should see two files and two directories
Example:
  % cd /home/mydir/unpackgui
  % ls -1F
  INSTALLME.sh
  README.txt
  installdir/
  gui/
  
4. Run installme.sh and follow the directions.
Note that you'll probably need to have full root 
privilege for everything to work properly.





========================================================================
Installation script:
1. look for /usr/bin/perl; crash and burn if it doesn't exist
