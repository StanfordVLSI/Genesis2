GUI BUG LIST
  title of new installation (index.htm) is always "Stanford edition"---oops!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
THIS IS STILL A LEGITIMATE BUG as of 1/9/2012

Comments in hashes: to see the problem, look at immutable parm
"PC2XBAR_REQ_SIGNALS" in TileGen-OS "top.DUT"; next to "click to expand";
it should say "List of interface signals between protocol controller 
and the Xbar"

% cd ChipGen/TileTest/TileGenTest
% cat hier*xml
...

  <Doc>List of interface signals between protocol controller and the Xbar</Doc>
  <Name>PC2XBAR_REQ_SIGNALS</Name>
...

Soon:
  - build a stewie_check
    - setup, design files should have list of valid hostnames e.g.
      "#Valid for hosts: neva.stanford.edu neva-2.stanford.edu ...
      stewie_check will say: "Found setup file valid for hosts:  neva.stanford.edu neva-2.stanford.edu..."
      "And you appear to be on host ..."
      "You need to edit the setup file (path), following the instructions found in the file..."
      (and then maybe cat the file header)
      (...same for design_list file...)
  - maybe the Stewie design list would be called "design_list_stewie.txt"
  - how do we verify perl pkgs in advance (HTTP::Server::Simple, HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI, e.g.)?
  - "download button"---last item in every design dir list should be "Import",
    allowing user to type the full pathname of a desired design (maybe starting from
    "__SOURCE_DIR__"

Todo's related to Ofer mail:
  - Subject: some xml related changes
  - Date: Saturday, February 11, 2012 9:00 PM
  - Add support for "SynonymFor"

"Choose design" shouldn't show "small_" or "tiny_" files, right?
  - But then how do we delete them?
  - Maybe have an option 'delete orphaned "small_" and "tiny_" files' or something?

'Calling build_xml_change_file() to create  ../foobar/SysCfgs/mydesign-120202-093046-changes.xml'
  => should show parameters being sent to build_xml_change_file...right!??

Need better way to determine hash vs. array
  - Add "h" or "a" at the beginning of each key name in javascript e.g. instead of
    "top.DUT.p0.SPECIAL. 0. name = foo" should be
    "top.DUT.p0.SPECIAL.a0.hname = foo"
     kind of hacky but I kinda like it...

Ofer's "top" bug fix will probably break if:
  - any module other than top has the name "top"
  - any module other than top has the same name as the top module
    (e.g. two modules in the hierarchy named (top_FMA))

misc
  - LINT for cg xml?  Same as first five passes?
  -- "<Name>" not first item in "<...>" block beginning at line 327" etc.

misc
  - to README , somewhere, add the phrase "the design directory should magically 
    appear in foo/bar/designs next time the gui starts..."

Later:

  - increase robustness of when multiple users access GUI at the same time

clean up updatedir tests---they probably don't work right now.
