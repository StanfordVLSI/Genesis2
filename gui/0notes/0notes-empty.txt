Does empty.xml work w/standalone?  look in utils.pl for "nlines < 5"
More generally: what's the right thing to do with empty files?
Maybe empty files should
  - alert("found empty file; will try to generate a new design")
  - jump to new design
And/or option for guisada to generate new design (using -out flag below?)
guisada should have a default output filename ("mydesign"?  ask the users)
