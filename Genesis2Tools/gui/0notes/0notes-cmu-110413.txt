Obsolete(?):
add to CONFIG:
  "#INSTALL_SITE Stanford results in e.g. "Welcome to Chip Generator at Stanford""
  "INSTALL_SITE Stanford # CMU should change to "CMU"
  - and then use it in updatedesign.csh instead of "if -e steveri"
CMU site should use title "Welcome to CG at CMU"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUI for CMU

Unpack the tarball such that <path> is the name of the top-level
directory containing "index.htm".  For instance, on our machine <path>
is "/home/steveri/ig" and the full pathname for index.htm is
"/home/steveri/ig/index.htm".

Use symbolic links to connect the top-level directory to your 
web server e.g. in our installation we did

  % ln -s /home/steveri/ig /var/www/homepage/ig 

such that the URL "http://www-vlsi.stanford.edu/ig" takes you to
"index.htm" and starts the gui.

Similarly, connect the <path>/cgi subdirectory to your web server's
cgi-bin directory; for instance, in our installation this is
accomplished by

  % ln -s /home/steveri/ig/cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ig

The GUI calls an "update" perl script using the URL 
"/cgi-bin/ig/updatedesign.pl" (see "Button_SubmitChanges.js).
You can test this by visiting the URL; e.g. if you visit
"http://www-vlsi.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/ig/updatedesign.pl"
you'll see a valid error message output:
"ERROR: new design name is null."  This indicates that the
perl script is in the right place (for Stanford's installation!)

At this point you may have to mess around with permissions a bit to
get everything working...good luck with that.
