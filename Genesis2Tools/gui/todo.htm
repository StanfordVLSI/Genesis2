Bugzilla bug list
</a>

<br /> = clean up todo file
<br /> = OOPS submit buttons in sublists DON'T WORK YET!!!
<br /> = grep through source code for SUBTODO, TODO, BUG
<br /> = grep for EGREGIOUS and defaultHACK in decode.pl


<p>Then:

<br /> = Read-only parameters
<br /> = Need to identify and handle lists differently; need an "add list item" button
<br /> = install a pointer from icg to ig and back


<p>Later:

<br /> = nav buttons should check to make sure no parms have changed
<br /> = and issue a warning "parms have changed; do you want to submit changes?"
<br />

<br /> = test on IE

<br /> = put names/icons of subsubmods in submod boxes
<br /> = PopUp really should be ParmBoxListPopup => at least the subparm-dependent parts
<br /> = maybe clean up ModuleBox.js, style.htm
<br /> = Need instructions: 'click (double-click?) a submodule to go down a level, click "UP" button to go up a level'
<br /> = shadow box for IO_LIST submenus?
<br /> = maybe need a "show hist" button
<p>
<br /> = Right-click on a module brings up module properties, and a list of submods (see below)
<br /> = Create new function "ShowModuleProperties(e)"
<br /> == Right-click on a box should give that module's properties, e.g.
<br /> ===Base_Module_Name
<br /> ===Instance_Name
<br /> ===Clone_Of
<br /> ===Unique_Module_Name
<p>
<br /> = other todo: search source for "TODO" and "BUG"
<br />

<hr><!-- ---------------------------------------- -->

<p><b>Obviated/went away on their own/changed my mind/already fixed:</b>
<br /> = Clicking "UP" clears sublists, pushing into a module should also clear.
<br /> = is "module dut" spanning both columns???
<br /> = module box should have a minimum width of two submodules...
         maybe this means that HowManyColumns or whatever it's called should
         always return "2" or greater.
<br /> = Entire first row of mod table (including "UP" button) should
         function like UP button
<br /> = Instead of "undefined," should just be absence-of-box.
<br /> = double-click of e.g. "ifc" should call NewModule(top.dut.ifc).
<br /> = clicking on "comp" results in "e is null" error
<br /> = add appropriate todo items from icg
<br /> = boxes should fit ipad window better---ipad and iphone 
have different aspect ratios!?  Current box fits both pretty well.

<hr><!-- ---------------------------------------- -->

<p><b>Testing:</b>

Testing subparm lists: begin at "top.DUT.p0"
<br /> = one-level test: "INST_OP_LIST" => "Cancel"
<br /> = two-level test: "SPECIAL_DATA_MEM_OPS" => "0" => "Cancel"
<br /> = out-of-scope tests: "INST_OP_LIST" => "DATA_OP_LIST"
<br /> = out-of-scope tests: "SPECIAL_DATA_MEM_OPS" => "0" => "INST_OP_LIST"


<hr><!-- ---------------------------------------- -->

<p><b>Done:</b>

<br /> == init() should call NewModule(top.dut)
<br /> = click on ifc should say "my name is top.dut.ifc"
<br /> = need "UP" button in top level module.
<br /> = Right-click on a module says "hey you rightclicked"
<br /> = Add parameters to param box.
<br /> = "module" box should be sized such that left edge of "parm" box doesn't jump around.
<br /> = in fact, size module box so that can fit up to 16 (12?) modules w/o changing outer boundary.
<br /> = 6/15 each IO_LIST (e.g.) should be a button that pops up a submenu for the IO_LIST values
<br /> = 6/15 want a new submenu for each parm list
<br /> = 6/15 need a "DONE" button to make the submenu go away. (Implemented Cancel, Submit)
<br /> = 6/16 Clean up Activate.js etc.
<br /> = 6/17 once there are two submenus on screen, the "cancel" buttons stop working
<br /> = 6/17 Related: click on "regfile_clk2" I think subparm lists are WRONG!!!
<br /> = Initial code clean-up (not yet).
<br /> = 6/17 From "top", clicking on "UP" makes "UP" stop working.
         (PRIORITY: THIS IS AN ACTUAL BUG!!)
<br /> = 6/21 subparm popups don't work so well as browser window gets narrower
<br /> = 6/21 mixed font sizes on parms looks dumb (subparms are too big)
<br /> = 6/21 iphone version now == regular version; merge/delete
<br /> = 6/22 consider: "UP" button on left, "BACK" button on right.  OR! "<", ">", "UP"
<br /> = 6/22 titles should be "top.dut" and "top.dut.template", not "dut" and "template"; also, put them on the left i guess
         if necessary, only show the last n letters of the string
<br /> = 6/22 really should clean up "ModuleNavigator.js"

<br /> = 8/1 "submit changes" button should do something---click on it and follow directions. (DONE)
<li>8/1 pop up an alert box with parm change, curdesign name, etc. (DONE)
<li>8/1 call a cgi script with parm change, curdesign name, etc. (DONE)

<br />8/1 "updatedesign.pl" needs to do more stuff
<li>8/1  build an xml-changes file
<li>8/1  use the xml-changes to produce a new xml dbase
<li>8/1  use the xml dbase to make a new javascript dbase
<li>8/1  use the new xml dbase as new design base for "updatedesign.pl"

<br />1/19/2011  cleaned up cgi files
<br />1/19 Design name now accommodates hyphens, underbars.
