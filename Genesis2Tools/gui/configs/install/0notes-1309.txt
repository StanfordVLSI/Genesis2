GUI TESTING

ask the group to check the gui like a naif
  - see online mail draft, ~/tmp-gui-vetting.txt


==============================================================================
GUI DOCUMENTATION

document stuff

WORKS (sorta):
su root
cpan
install HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI 

DOES NOT WORK:
sudo cpan -i HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI 




WRONG Might be a problem with TCL_LIBRARY?
WRONG   setenv TCL_LIBRARY /usr/share/tcl8.4 or maybe
WRONG   setenv TCL_LIBRARY /usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.4

GUI IS GOING TO BREAK when vlsiweb reboots because there's no
automount for /cad => FIXED added /cad to /etc/fstab 9/2013


VLSIWEB REBOOT PROBLEMS that cropped up after vlsiweb died and had to
be restored from three years back.

1. GUI could not find synopsys tools because /cad not mounted.  Fixed by:
  - mounted /cad on vlsiweb (with Charlie's help):
    sudo mount whirlpool.stanford.edu:/vol/vgates/cad /cad
    - Note this is not permanent and WILL REVERT when/if vlsiweb reboots
  - made a symbolic link for the missing /hd/cad:
    sudo mkdir /hd; cd /hd; sudo ln -s /cad

mtab looks like this:
  whirlpool.stanford.edu:/vol/vgates/cad /cad nfs rw,addr=172.24.74.33 0 0

added to /etc/fstab:
  whirlpool.stanford.edu:/vol/vgates/cad /cad nfs rw 0 0


2. GUI could not find path to TCL libraries.  Fixed by:
  - added to $SMASH/bin/setup.cshrc:
        source /cad/modules/tcl/init/csh
        module load base
  - added to ~/gui/configs/setup_stanford.cshrc:
        source /cad/modules/tcl/init/csh
        module load base
        module load genesis2

3. /hd/cad/modules/modulefiles/modules (at least) had a dependence on
/hd/horowitz_users/zasgar, which did not exist on vlsiweb, so I made
the following adjustment that, in later hindsight, may not have been
strictly necessary:

    cd /hd; sudo ln -s /home horowitz_users
    ls /hd/horowitz_users/zasgar


  - see how much "what i did" can be undone and still work,


What I did and then later undid:
  - install tcl on vlsiweb
    sudo apt-get install tcl
  - undid it as follows maybe
    apt-get uninstall tcl



documentation
  - add pre-test to the wiki documentation somewhere/somehow
    - see gui/README.txt "DESIGN PRE-TEST" for the pre-test info


==============================================================================


Later:
  clean up remaining perforce-open files.
  - fix configs/index_* ; in the end there can be only one.
