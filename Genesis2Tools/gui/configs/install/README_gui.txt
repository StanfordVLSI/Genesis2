Short answer (note you're probably already now in $GENESIS_HOME/gui/install/):

  ssh vlsiweb
  cd $GENESIS_HOME/gui/install
  sudo ./INSTALL.sh

Long answer: To install the GUI (and Genesis2), see instructions on the wiki at

    http://genesis2.stanford.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Interactive_Genesis2_GUI#Brief_setup_and_usage_instructions_for_each_flavor_of_GUI

and/or maybe

    http://genesis2.stanford.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Original_GUI_Installation_Details#How_do_I_install_the_GUI_at_my_site.3F

The instructions give you two options, one to install the GUI as a
publicly-available application ("Original GUI") that runs under an
existing web server (such as apache), and a separate option to install
a private standalone version of the GUI ("Stewie") that runs as a
user.
